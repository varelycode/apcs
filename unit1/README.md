# Unit 1

Suggested Activities:
1 1.1 Error analysis
Provide students with code that contains syntax errors. Ask students to identify
and correct the errors in the provided code. Once they feel they have identified and
corrected all syntax errors, have them verify their conclusion by using a compiler and
an IDE that does not autocorrect errors.
2 1.3 Activating prior knowledge
The basic arithmetic operators of +, âˆ’, /, and \* are similar to what students have
experienced in math class or when using a calculator. Give students a list of expressions
and ask them to apply what they know from math class to evaluate the meaning of the
expressions. Have them verify their results by putting them into a compiler.
3 1.4 Sharing and responding
Put student into groups of two. Provide each student with a different set of
statements; in each pair, one student should have a list of statements that contain
compound assignment operators, while the other student should have a list of
statements that accomplish the same thing without using compound statements.
Be sure the statements are in a different order. Students should take turns describing
what a statement does to their partner, and the partner should determine which
statement of theirs is equivalent to the one being described.
4 1.5 Predict and compare
Provide students with several statements that involve casting. Each cast should be
on a different value in the statement. Have students predict the resulting value. For
any statements that would not compile or work as intended, have students explain
the problem and propose a solution. They should verify their results by putting those
results into a compiler.

## Unit 1.1

- Determine the result or output based on
  statement execution order in a code segment
  without method calls (other than output).
- Identify errors in program code

Essential Knowledge

- System.out.println moves the cursor to a
  new line after the information has been displayed,
  while System.out.print does not.

# Unit 1.2

- Determine an appropriate program design
  to solve a problem or accomplish a task (not
  assessed)

- Determine code that would be used to
  complete code segments.

Essentials

- Data types can be categorized as either
  primitive or reference.
- The primitive data types used in this course
  define the set of operations for numbers and
  Boolean values.
- Each variable has associated memory that is
  used to hold its value.
- The memory associated with a variable of a
  primitive type holds an actual primitive value.
- When a variable is declared final, its value
  cannot be changed once it is initialized.

# Unit 1.3 Expression and Assignment Statements

- Determine code that would be used to
  complete code segments.
- Apply the meaning of specific operators

# Unit 1.4 Compound Assignment Operators

- Determine the result or output based on
  statement execution order in a code segment
  without method calls (other than output).
- Describe the behavior of a given segment of
  program code.

# Unit 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables

- Determine the result or output based on
  statement execution order in a code segment
  without method calls (other than output).
- Explain why a code segment will not compile
  or work as intended.
